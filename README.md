# Welcome to Pilandia
## Social Artware

Have you heard of micronations? All over the world, there are people who set out to create their own countries in their backyards (and even on offshore rigs!). Even though these countries aren't recognized by larger international organizations, they often have many of the things one might associate with a country-- flags, currency, post offices...

While we have freedom of speech here in the United States, social networks have some degree of domain over your speech, as they are private entities.

Pilandia is its very own digital micronation, deployed on a microcontroller. It's an answer to the larger social networks/nations of the internet. Pilandia has domain over your speech, too, so be nice!
